# Projects
I have done a few projects over the years, from web application, mobile application, to data mining projects, that I gradually commited to Github. Some of the highlights are described below.

### Web Application (PHP and Laravel 5.1)
#### Program Sistem Informasi Rawat Jalan (Program for Hospital Inpatient Information System) - 2015
Program Sistem Informasi Rawat Jalan (Program for Hospital Inpatient Information System), a web based application created with PHP framework Laravel 5.1.

With collaboration with my friend [@kuroipearls](https://github.com/kuroipearls), this project was made for *System Design and Analysis* class. My contribution was designing the backend part of the project, which include writing PHP code and MySQL queries.

### Android Application (Java)
#### EmergencyCalls - 2015
An android application to fetch closest emergency places address and phone numbers based on user's location. The application uses Google Maps API to fetch the user's location and other places in vicinity.

With collaboration with my friend [@Maulia](https://github.com/Maulia), this project was originally made for *Mobile Application Development* class.

### Data Science
#### Traffic Accidents Monitoring in Indonesia from Twitter - 2016
Another collaboration with [@kuroipearls](https://github.com/kuroipearls), this project was done to fulfill the requisites for Gemastik 9 final category Data Mining. The result subsequently got us into the final.

In this project, the tweets fetched from Twitter are first preprocessed using text mining technique. The preprocessed data are then classified using Naive Bayes classifier into positive and negative, positive means the tweet is positively-linked to traffic accident in Indonesia and negative means the tweet is negatively-linked to traffic accident. From 600 tweets, with 224 classified as positive and 376 negative, used in the experiment using 10 fold cross validation, the accuracy obtained is 95% with 130 points of location successfully extracted and visualized into a map.

#### Tension Detection to Filter Hate Speech on Twitter - 2017
Another collaboration with [@kuroipearls](https://github.com/kuroipearls), this project was done to fulfill the requisites for Gemastik 10 final category Data Mining.

This project aimed to investigate the possibility of identifying which opinion on Twitter, in the form of tweets delivered by its users, may cause tension and lead to hate speech against the President. We approached our idea using text mining, probabilistic method, and machine learning method with a dataset containing 574 tweets of various degrees of tension and hatred collected from Twitter.

#### Review Rating Prediction (Final Project) - 2018
This project was done for my undergraduate thesis. Using the data from [here](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) fetched from Amazon, I built a model to predict the appropriate star ratings for the text reviews of Amazon movies and TV shows using Natural Language Processing and methods like Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
