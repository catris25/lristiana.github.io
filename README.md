## Data Science
#### Traffic Accidents Monitoring in Indonesia on Twitter - 2016
Another collaboration with [@kuroipearls](https://github.com/kuroipearls), this project was done to fulfill the requisites for Gemastik final category Data Mining. The result subsequently got us into the final.

In this project, the tweets fetched from Twitter are first preprocessed using text mining technique. The preprocessed data are then classified using Naive Bayes classifier into positive and negative, positive means the tweet is positively-linked to traffic accident in Indonesia and negative means the tweet is negatively-linked to traffic accident. From 600 tweets, with 224 classified as positive and 376 negative, used in the experiment using 10 fold cross validation, the accuracy obtained is 95% with 130 points of location successfully extracted and visualized into a map.
